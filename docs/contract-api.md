## Factory Contract

### Overview

Central on-chain registry for all deployed JointSave pool contracts. Because Soroban contracts cannot deploy other contracts at runtime, pool contracts are deployed separately (via CLI or SDK) and then registered here. The factory stores the global token address, treasury, and the lists of all registered pool contract IDs.

**Use when:** discovering all pools of a given type, or verifying that a pool contract was registered by a trusted caller.

**Deployed address (testnet):** `CBZNGP52FLFZ4BOGC265FUAMP5KFMAYPQK3KTI5UHMYVMM3QCST3IMRI`

### Deployment

The factory is deployed directly from its WASM (not from a hash):

```bash
FACTORY_ID=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/jointsave_factory.wasm \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet)

stellar contract invoke \
  --id $FACTORY_ID \
  --source ADMIN_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin GADMIN... \
  --token native \
  --treasury GTREASURY...
```

### Functions

| Function | Parameters | Returns | Auth Required | Description |

| `("tgt_reg", caller: Address)` | `pool_id: BytesN<32>` | A target pool is registered. |
| `("flx_reg", caller: Address)` | `pool_id: BytesN<32>` | A flexible pool is registered. |

### Storage Keys

| Key | Type | Lifetime | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Admin` | `Address` | Persistent | Factory administrator address. |
| `Token` | `Address` | Persistent | SPL token address used across all pools. |
| `Treasury` | `Address` | Persistent | Treasury address to receive protocol fees. |
| `Rotational` | `Vec<BytesN<32>>` | Persistent | List of registered rotational pool contract IDs. |

### Error Conditions

| Assertion | Trigger Condition |
|---|---|
| (implicit auth panic) | `initialize` called by non-`admin` address. |
| (implicit auth panic) | `register_*` called without `caller` signature. |
| (implicit auth panic) | `set_treasury` called by non-`admin` address. |

> **Note:** `initialize` uses `admin.require_auth()` so the admin must be the transaction source or have authorized the call. Subsequent view calls like `token()` and `all_rotational()` panic with `unwrap()` if called before `initialize` (storage key absent).

### Example CLI Invocations

```bash
# Query token address
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CBZNGP52FLFZ4BOGC265FUAMP5KFMAYPQK3KTI5UHMYVMM3QCST3IMRI \
  --network testnet \
  -- token

## Rotational Pool Contract

### Overview

Implements a rotating savings group (known as a "tanda", "chit fund", or "susu" in various cultures). Members contribute a fixed amount each round; the full pot is paid out to one member per round in order. The pool ends after every member has received a payout.

**Use when:** a group of trusted members wants to take turns receiving a lump-sum payout funded by all members' equal contributions.

**WASM Hash (testnet):** `d350a325d8734263a3d7150c875555d8956e13a527fb3497d5141b8b3f3d2c74`

### Deployment

Pool contracts are deployed from an installed WASM hash, not from a file:

```bash
# Deploy a new rotational pool instance
NEW_POOL=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash d350a325d8734263a3d7150c875555d8956e13a527fb3497d5141b8b3f3d2c74 \
  --source CALLER_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet)

# Initialize (values are examples)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $NEW_POOL \
  --source CALLER_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --token native \
  --members '["GMEMBER1...", "GMEMBER2...", "GMEMBER3..."]' \
  --deposit_amount 10000000 \
  --round_duration 604800 \
  --treasury_fee_bps 100 \
  --relayer_fee_bps 50 \
  --treasury GTREASURY...
```

> `deposit_amount` is in stroops (1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops).  
> `round_duration` is in seconds.  
> Fee params are in basis points (100 bps = 1%).

## Target Pool Contract

### Overview

Goal-based savings pool. Members deposit freely toward a shared target amount before a deadline (expressed as a ledger sequence number). When the total deposited reaches the target, funds unlock and members can withdraw their proportional share. If the deadline passes without hitting the target, the admin can trigger a full refund.

**Use when:** a group wants to save toward a specific collective goal (e.g., equipment purchase, shared event) with a deadline.

## Flexible Pool Contract

### Overview

Open-ended savings pool with variable deposit amounts, withdrawal fees, and optional proportional yield distribution. Members can deposit any amount above the minimum and withdraw at any time, paying a fee that goes to the treasury. An admin/relayer can distribute externally earned yield proportionally to all members with a balance.

**Use when:** a group wants a shared savings pool without fixed amounts or schedules, optionally connected to a yield source.

## Fee Formula Reference

All fee calculations use basis points (bps). 100 bps = 1%.

```
fee     = (amount × fee_bps) / 10000
net     = amount − fee
```

**Rotational payout example** — 3 members × 10 XLM = 30 XLM collected, treasury_fee_bps = 100, relayer_fee_bps = 50:

```
treasury_cut = (30_000_000 × 100) / 10000 = 300_000 stroops (0.03 XLM)
relayer_cut  = (30_000_000 × 50)  / 10000 = 150_000 stroops (0.015 XLM)
payout       = 30_000_000 − 300_000 − 150_000 = 29_550_000 stroops (2.955 XLM)
```

**Flexible withdrawal example** — withdraw 10 XLM, withdrawal_fee_bps = 50:

```
fee = (10_000_000 × 50) / 10000 = 50_000 stroops (0.005 XLM)
net = 10_000_000 − 50_000 = 9_950_000 stroops (0.995 XLM)
```
